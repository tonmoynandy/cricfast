Preview:</b>"},{"timestamp":"1519384128260","i_id":"0","evt":"other","comm":"It started as a run-feast. Dane van Niekerk and Lizelle Lee set the foundation, smashed it to all parts of the ground and just as they were looking to carry forward the momentum they'd gathered in Jo'burg, the heavens opened up, and the series shut. Trailing 2-1 in the series and just the one match to go, all South Africa can now manage is to ensure that India do not run away with the T20I trophy as well.<br/><br/>For India though, there's a lot more at stake. A rare opportunity to fly out with a double limited-overs whammy, an opportunity to roll on the post World Cup momentum and a rarer opportunity to do it on television, live. The couple of changes they made in the last game, looking to strengthen their bowling resources with Rumeli Dhar and Deepti Sharma coming in, didn't quite inspire a great deal of confidence. Neither did Rajeshwari Gayakwad's slow left-arm loop ups, towards whom the batters took a special liking.<br/><br/>It comes as worrying signs for a side that seemed highly dominant in the first two T20Is, after which it was the batting that collapsed at the Wanderers and the bowling that lacked incision at the SuperSport Park. Mithali Raj didn't mince words, pointing out to a great deal of work that the spinners would have to put in. Having opted to bowl first, perhaps with the threats of rain in mind, India might also want to rethink this strategy, given the amount of freedom Lee and Niekerk went about with, in the absence of a target.<br/><br/>South Africa's concerns about their openers not getting them off to a start were set to bed the last time around. It would be difficult to see them tinkering around with their eleven, especially after (almost) two near-perfect outings. India on the other hand too would look to persist with their eleven, although the temptation of adding another pacer in the form of Shikha Pandey is likely, given the ease with which spin was dealt with.<br/><br/>Right then, a super Saturday (February 24) beckons, where an afternoon of the Women chasing/avoiding history gives way to an evening of the Men's decider. Thankfully, the rain isn't bothering to interfere this time around. It better not.<br/><br/><b>When:</b> South Africa Women vs India Women, 5th T20I - Saturday, February 24 at 13:00 Local (16:30 IST)<br/><br/><b>Where:</b> Newlands, Cape Town<br/><br/><b>What to expect:</b> As the action switches from the high altitudes of Pretoria to the coast, expect gravity to get a lot stronger and hence the six-hitting parabolas to get a lot shorter. But the intensity is bound to be right up there, for it's history taking on pride. The forecast is for a cool afternoon, with the mercury touching a maximum of 22-degrees Celcius and some rain-free clouds hovering around.<br/><br/><b>What they said:</b><br/><br/>\"A lot of work is needed in terms of our spin. The wickets are batter-friendly and more conducive for high scoring [in South Africa], so the spinners have a lot more to work on. And the lower order needs to contribute with the bat, because not in every game the batters will score runs.\" - Mithali Raj<br/><br/>Squads<br/><br/><b>South Africa:</b> Dane van Niekerk (c), Marizanne Kapp, Trisha Chetty (wk), Shabnim Ismail, Ayabonga Khaka, Masabata Klaas, Sune Luus, Odine Kirsten, Mignon du Preez, Lizelle Lee (wk), Chloe Tryon, Nadine de Klerk, Raisibe Ntozakhe, Moseline Daniels<br/><br/><b>India:</b> Harmanpreet Kaur (c), Smriti Mandhana, Mithali Raj, Veda Krishnamurthy, Jemimah Rodrigues, Deepti Sharma, Anuja Patil, Taniya Bhatia (wk), Nuzhat Parween (wk), Poonam Yadav, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Shikha Pandey, Pooja Vastrakar, Radha Yadav, Rumeli Dhar"},{"timestamp":"1519384128159","i_id":"0","evt":"other","comm":"<b>Teams:</b>"},{"timestamp":"1519384126789","i_id":"0","evt":"other","comm":"<b>India Women</b> (From): Mithali Raj, Smriti Mandhana, Harmanpreet Kaur(c), Jemimah Rodrigues, Veda Krishnamurthy, Deepti Sharma, Shikha Pandey, Taniya Bhatia(w), Pooja Vastrakar, Poonam Yadav, Rumeli Dhar, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Anuja Patil, Nuzhat Parween, Radha Yadav"},{"timestamp":"1519384000448","i_id":"0","evt":"other","comm":"<b>South Africa Women</b> (From): Lizelle Lee(w), Dane van Niekerk(c), Chloe Tryon, Sune Luus, Mignon du Preez, Nadine de Klerk, Marizanne Kapp, Shabnim Ismail, Masabata Klaas, Moseline Daniels, Raisibe Ntozakhe, Trisha Chetty, Ayabonga Khaka, Odine Kirsten"}]},"updatedAt":"2018-02-23 19:36:18"}
