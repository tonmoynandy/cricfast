Really pleased with the way the boys played. Marsh deserved a hundred in the first innings. Tail contributed really well. They contributed a 130-odd which was the difference in the end. Really good game of cricket. Both are tough. Winning the toss and batting was ideal, probably the best of the conditions. Reverse-swing played a part throughout the game. It probably started reversing as early as the 25th over which is rare. It was a hard-fought Test match. Aiden Markram played exceptionally well, Quinton de Kock played well. It was getting a bit nervous there. Those guys were batting really well. With Mitch Marsh breaking the partnership, it made things easier. The new ball was probably the best time to bat. We just thought if we got one wicket, the way Starc bowls to the tail, it will happen very quickly. If we hadn't come off last night, it would have been over last night itself. But it was pretty dark to be fair. Really well prepared. Our practice and our practice game before this Test match was spot on. Got our plans in place for a quality opposition.

To finish off the Test match like that in four and a bit days was very pleasing. Reversing the ball is going all right. Little bit of work to do with the new ball. As a bowling unit we've been doing well. The batsmen did well in the first innings to get to 350. Could have put a bit more on in the second innings. It's a more natural wrist position for me. When it is reversing, it's natural for me. With the new ball, I've got work to do to keep the seam upright. Our group probably got stuck in two minds for the home summer. Had a couple of weeks to work on a few things. Contributing with the bat is always encouraging for the tail, that's what we showed in the first innings - to add runs with Mitch Marsh who was batting fantastically. Great contribution from the whole side. Didn't mind who took the final wicket.

Credit to their tail how they batted along with Mitch Marsh. His was a very good knock. If you look throughout the Test, both teams were around 150-160/5 in both innings. There were real opportunities for us to close it out. Mitchell Starc bowled beautifully to make sure the tail didn't get many runs. Batters need to cash in and take responsibility once they get in. There wasn't enough partnerships for us. We just didn't get enough runs in the first innings. Massive positive for us, how we came back in the second innings. When you're in a position of strength like Australia were on day 4, they generally blow you away quickly. Kesh was brilliant in this match. The character of the batters who got runs. De Bruyn and Markram were fantastic. And then Quinny there at the end. Really proud of our fight. Just not good enough to beat Australia who were good in this game.

It's taken Australia close to 350, something that they would've taken with both hands when day 2 started. <b>Mitchell Marsh c Morne Morkel b Philander 96(173) [4s-13 6s-1]</b>"},{"timestamp":"1519989221555","i_id":"1","evt":"other","comm":"Philander to Mitchell Marsh, <b>THAT'S OUT!!</b> Caught!!"},{"timestamp":"1519989169330","i_id":"1","o_no":"109.1","b_no":"655","score":"341","wkts":"8","batsman":[{"id":"6250","strike":"1","4s":"13","6s":"1","r":"96","b":"172"}],"bowler":[{"id":"731","o":"26","m":"12","r":"57","w":"2","n":"0","wd":"0"}],"evt":"four","all_evt":["four"],"video":"0_dptwegg9","comm":"Philander to Mitchell Marsh, <b>FOUR</b>, lucky lucky.

It might turn more tomorrow. The surface isn't crumbling as much as we initially thought. Starc might rough up one side and bring Gazza (Lyon) into play.

It follows that the ball will grip and turn on these surfaces - the closest South African pitches will ever get to a dustbowl.

No verbal diarrhea caught on the stump mic (not to mention, pub fights) which have become part and parcel of the Ashes, no intense confrontations laced with regional expletives in India-Pakistan matches. None of that. There exists no sense of contrived nationalism or ego-clash in this rivalry. It’s just South Africa versus Australia in in fairly neutral/familiar conditions for both; arguably the most evenly-matched contest in the world. Just pure and unadulterated cricket."},{"timestamp":"1519810046569","i_id":"0","evt":"other","comm":"For one thing, the <i>typical</i> pitch conditions in South Africa are as extremely similar to those in Australia.

It has arguably been cricket's most competitive rivalry over a long period of time, one that almost always spits out riveting contests.<br/><br/>In a major quirk to the norm, home ground has meant little in these matches. The Proteas have memorably won their past three series Down Under countered by Australia enjoying a remarkable unbeaten record in South Africa since readmission. They have won five of seven series and seem to have a knack of raising their game in terrain that is reminiscent of back home.<br/><br/>After a lopsided and, truth be told, laborious Ashes, there is expectation that this series will produce plenty of pyrotechnics with both teams armed with menacing bowling attacks complemented by several high-octane batsmen.<br/><br/>However, tempering the expected fireworks show, the Kingsmead pitch is tipped to be slower than the pace-friendly wickets during the Indian series where ball thoroughly dominated bat leading to shortened matches across the three-Test series.<br/><br/>The makeup of the pitch adds intrigue to a contest between two evenly matched teams who both have similar strengths and weaknesses. Australia are deemed to have a slight edge mainly due to continuity as selectors have stuck with the same line-up that thrashed England in the fifth Test in early January.<br/><br/>Enjoying the rarity of sporting such a stable team, the only question mark for Australia appears to be opener Cameron Bancroft, who struggled towards the backend of his debut series in the Ashes. Bancroft aside, Australia's batting has long underwhelmed but they clicked into gear as the Ashes wore on and were considerably strengthened due to the strong performances of the maligned Marshes [Shaun and Mitchell] in the middle-order.<br/><br/>The Western Australian pair, along with the temperamental Usman Khawaja, will be required to stand up overseas in a major test for the trio. They will be called upon to ease the burden of leaders Steve Smith and David Warner who have done much of the heavy lifting in recent years.<br/><br/>Warner starred with three tons in Australia's stunning triumph in 2014 and should relish the familiar conditions, while the incomparable Smith is batting almost as well as anyone in Test cricket. South Africa's brains trust would have noted England's plethora of unsuccessful tactics to Smith and it will be highly interesting to see what strategy they start with in Durban.<br/><br/>Even though there is lingering scepticism over the batting, Australia's brilliant attack papers over those flaws. As shown during the Ashes, the attack can still eke out wickets on flat pitches; with some assistance, star quicks Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins become almost unplayable.<br/><br/>Offspinner Nathan Lyon, so often underrated, is no longer forgotten after being last year's leading wicket-taker in world cricket. With the potential for turn to play a role in Durban, Lyon could well become Australia's unsung hero once again. How he fares against the aggressive AB de Villiers and nemesis Quinton de Kock could well shape the series.<br/><br/>It all looks rosy on paper but the injury bane is always a worry for Australia's often injury-prone quicks. With a tight four-Test schedule on the back of a gruelling summer, there is legitimate concern over whether the trio can make it through unscathed. Uncapped quicks Chadd Sayers and Jhye Richardson are waiting in reserve but won't strike the same fear if called upon even though Sayers has a stellar First-Class record.<br/><br/>Australia's depth looks shallower than South Africa but the hosts have a few headaches with captain Faf du Plessis recovering from a broken finger. However, he is set to take his place. South Africa's most pressing issue revolves around team balance. Against India, they successfully backed a five-pronged bowling attack but that formula leaves the batting looking susceptible.<br/><br/>Much like against England, Australia has promised to unleash a bouncer barrage at the tail and South Africa could roll over quickly if they play just six specialist batsmen exacerbated by de Kock's form struggles. Wiann Mulder, the young all-rounder, could be in line to debut in a bid to strengthen the batting, while left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj is set to be recalled after troubling Australia in the last series Down Under, while being a handy batsman down the order.<br/><br/>South Africa's quicks will be relied upon to reopen Australia's batting scars and they have the artillery to do so even without the ailed Dale Steyn. In his last series, Morne Morkel is hoping to go out on a high and deliver more memorable spells akin to his breathtaking burst to then Australian captain Michael Clarke.<br/><br/>With the teams not scheduled to meet for at least two-and-a-half years, this signals the end of an era with a number of South Africans set to play their final series against Australia. Morkel aside, de Villiers, Hashim Amla, Vernon Philander and du Plessis - who has a knack of getting under the skin of the Australians - could be farewelling this great rivalry.<br/><br/>It all shapes as an absorbing month-long of action between two teams who rarely disappoint when pitted against each other.<br/><br/><b>When:</b> Thursday, March 1, 2018; 10 AM local, 1.30 PM IST<br/><br/><b>Where:</b> Kingsmead, Durban<br/><br/><b>What to expect:</b> The weather should be fine throughout the Test. There is much intrigue over the wicket after spicy wickets marked the Indian series. However, the pitch is tipped to produce more balance between bat and ball with the Kingsmead pitch traditionally one of the slowest surfaces in South Africa. Spinners have also had much success there over the years.<br/><br/><b>Team News</b><br/><br/><b>South Africa</b><br/><br/>Temba Bavuma is still recovering from a hand injury and is not available for selection, but Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers and Quinton de Kock have all overcome their injury problems. South Africa's main issue is whether to stick with four out-and-out fast bowlers, or pick an extra batsman. Wiaan Mulder offers a third option if they want to play a bowling allrounder. But the likeliest outcome is the seven-batsmen route, with Theunis de Bruyn coming into the side.<br/><br/><b>Probable XI:</b> Dean Elgar, Aiden Markram, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, Faf du Plessis (capt), Theunis de Bruyn, Quinton de Kock (wk), Vernon Philander, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Morne Morkel.<br/><br/><b>Australia</b><br/><br/>Australia has the same line-up that destroyed England in the fifth Test in Sydney in early January.<br/><br/><b>Probable XI:</b> David Warner, Cameron Bancroft, Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith (c), Shaun Marsh, Mitchell Marsh, Tim Paine (wk), Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Lyon<br/><br/><b>Did you know</b><br/><br/>Nathan Lyon is 10 wickets shy of 300 Test scalps. He would be the first Australian offspinner to reach that milestone and the fifth offspinner overall.<br/><br/>Since readmission, South Africa have won just one of four Tests in Durban against Australia - the famous five-wicket triumph in the third-Test in 2002 where they successfully chased 340. It was the last Test Australia would lose with Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne both in the side - the legendary pair retired almost five years later.<br/><br/>With 8736 runs, Hashim Amla is closing in on becoming the 15th batsman to reach 9000 Test runs. Jacques Kallis and Graeme Smith are the only South Africans to reach that milestone.<br/><br/>At 63.75, Steve Smith has the highest Test batting average behind Sir Donald Bradman.<br/><br/><b>What they said</b><br/><br/>\"It's the most competitive series that you play. We are both very passionate and competitive countries and we try and leave it all out there on the field.\" - <b>Faf du Plessis</b>, the South African captain.<br/><br/>\"Conditions wise it's as similar as you get to back home but you're still away from home and they're a good team.
