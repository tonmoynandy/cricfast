They look all business out there, getting into a huddle before striding off. There's still some work to be done, but the bowlers have done their best to set things up. Right from the time Mujeeb knocked over Gayle at the top, the Afghan spinners maintained a stranglehold on proceedings, barely allowing the batsmen any leeway. The pressure was sustained later by Mohammad Nabi, who struck first ball to become the first Afghanistan player with 100 ODi wickets. Rashid was brilliant too. All that pressure paid off with Windies unraveling towards the end, losing four wickets for 11 runs at one stage. It's not over though. We've seen Afghanistan falter in a very similar run-chase before. They can't afford for that to happen today. High pressure chase coming up.."},{"score":"197","wkts":"8","o_no":"49.6","b_no":"300","i_id":"1","bt_tm_name":"WI","o_summary":"1Nb 1 6 1B 1L 1 1 ","o_runs":"13","batsman":[{"id":"7922","strike":"1","4s":"0","6s":"0","r":"10","b":"15"},{"id":"11214","strike":"0","4s":"0","6s":"1","r":"16","b":"18"}],"bowler":[{"id":"8029","o":"8","m":"1","r":"44","w":"0"}],"timestamp":"1521111308596","evt":"over-break"},{"timestamp":"1521111308581","i_id":"1","o_no":"49.6","b_no":"300","score":"197","wkts":"8","batsman":[{"id":"7922","strike":"1","4s":"0","6s":"0","r":"10","b":"15"},{"id":"11214","strike":"0","4s":"0","6s":"1","r":"16","b":"18"}],"bowler":[{"id":"8029","o":"8","m":"1","r":"44","w":"0","n":"2","wd":"1"}],"evt":"other","all_evt":["over-break"],"video":"0_a4r9wt08","comm":"Dawlat Zadran to Nurse, 1 run, premeditates a scoop, Zadran bangs it short outside off and it deflects off Nurse's arm as he tries to get behind the line of it.
