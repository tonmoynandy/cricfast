Let me just start off by saying: <b>eight-frickin-hundred - the highest score in the history of Irani trophy.</b> 7 wickets in the first 10 sessions didn't really promise much for the bowlers - and it's no wonder that the Vidarbha bowlers didn't want to take the field. Nevertheless, when they did come out, seam, swing, reverse-swing, scrambled seam, everything came into play. 98/6 they were, and in deep waters. Rajneesh Gurbani was the villain again (for ROI) with the new ball and old. It's only when the ball got beyond old that Vihari and Jayant started to accelerate and the final session belonged to ROI. We'll be back tomorrow with the final day's play. Until then, it's a worn-out <b>Rishi Roy</b> signing off along with <b>Nikhil Jadhav</b>, <b>Varun Dixit</b>, and <b>Siva</b>.
