Two evenly-matched sides produced a compelling match in the first ODI, the home side winning by three wickets in the last over, and it promises to be another interesting match-up at the beautiful Bay Oval.<br/><br/>New Zealand will be going in search of their tenth straight ODI victory, equalling their best ever run, but may have to do it without their captain and best player Kane Williamson who has a hamstring strain. His absence would leave the home side's batting looking rather reliant on Martin Guptill and Ross Taylor, who scored a brilliant hundred in Hamilton, and if England can once again make early inroads as David Willey and Chris Woakes did in the opening match, New Zealand could struggle.<br/><br/>By their own admission, England were sloppy in Hamilton, profligate in the field and strangely subdued with the bat albeit on a sluggish surface. They will be buoyed by the fact that they could - and perhaps should - have beaten New Zealand even when not at their best and the returning players not involved in the recent T20 series - Woakes, Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali and Jonny Bairstow - should be better for the hit out.<br/><br/>Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui is a picturesque ground in New Zealand's north island, surrounded by grass banks and overlooked by an imposing volcanic cone whose summit is some 232 metres above sea level. The ground has hosted just four ODIs, the last of which was over a year ago when the home side defeated Sri Lanka by 36 runs, but it was also the venue for New Zealand's T20I defeat to Pakistan last month. A few weeks earlier, the home side scored 243 for 5 in a T20I against West Indies there.<br/><br/><b>When:</b> Wednesday February 28, 2018. 01:00am GMT<br/><br/><b>Where:</b> Bay Oval, Mount Maunganui<br/><br/><b>What to expect:</b> The pitch is expected to offer more pace and bounce than the one in Hamilton which could mean that both teams opt to play the extra seamer. Although the forecast has largely cleared up, there still may be the odd shower in the evening.<br/><br/><b>Team News</b><br/><br/><b>New Zealand:</b> If skipper Kane Williamson is forced out the match because of a hamstring strain, fast-bowler Tim Southee is expected to lead the team with batsman Mark Chapman called up as cover. New Zealand could also add quick Lockie Ferguson to their final eleven, perhaps in place of leg-spinner Ish Sodhi.<br/><br/><b>England:</b> The visitors are likely to be without Mark Wood who is suffering from an ankle injury and underwent a precautionary scan on Monday. Although the ECB do not think it serious, they are unlikely to risk one of their most prized assets. England could consider bringing fast-bowler Craig Overton in for his ODI debut but will more likely stick with the attack which played in Hamilton.<br/><br/><b>What they said:</b><br/><br/>\"There'll be some minor adjustments there but throughout the year, even when Kane hasn't played, we've been able to put in a performance\" - <b>Mike Hesson</b>, the New Zealand coach, is confident that New Zealand can manage should Kane Williamson not play.<br/><br/>\"There have been times when you come through it and you bowl that last over and you're the hero. There are other times when it goes against you. Unfortunately, it did\" - <b>Chris Woakes</b>, has made peace with the fact that the margins between being a hero or a 'zero' are fairly slim."},{"timestamp":"1519702672050","i_id":"0","evt":"other","comm":"<b>Teams:</b>"},{"timestamp":"1519702665378","i_id":"0","evt":"other","comm":"<b>New Zealand</b> (From): Martin Guptill, Colin Munro, Kane Williamson(c), Ross Taylor, Tom Latham(w), Henry Nicholls, Colin de Grandhomme, Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Ish Sodhi, Trent Boult, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Todd Astle"},{"timestamp":"1519702614643","i_id":"0","evt":"other","comm":"<b>England</b> (From): Jason Roy, Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, David Willey, Tom Curran, Adil Rashid, Craig Overton, Mark Wood, Sam Billings, Alex Hales"}]},"updatedAt":"2018-02-28 16:42:59"}
